/**
 * @title Bi-directional bridge for transferring FET tokens between Ethereum and Fetch Mainnet-v2
 * @notice This bridge allows to transfer [ERC20-FET] tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to [Native FET] tokens on Fetch
 *         Native Mainnet-v2 and **other way around** (= it is bi-directional).
 *         User will be *charged* swap fee defined in counterpart contract deployed on Fetch Native Mainnet-v2.
 *         In the case of a refund, user will be charged a swap fee configured in this contract.
 * @dev There are three primary actions defining business logic of this contract:
 *       * `swap(...)`: initiates swap of tokens from Ethereum to Fetch Native Mainnet-v2, callable by anyone (= users)
 *       * `reverseSwap(...)`: finalises the swap of tokens in *opposite* direction = receives swap originally
 *                             initiated on Fetch Native Mainnet-v2, callable exclusively by `relayer` role
 *       * `refund(...)`: refunds swap originally initiated in this contract(by `swap(...)` call), callable exclusively
 *                        by `relayer` role
 *      Swap Fees are handled by the counterpart contract on Fetch Native Mainnet-v2, **except** for refunds, for
 *      which user is changed swap fee defined by this contract (since relayer needs to send refund transaction back to
 *      this contract.
