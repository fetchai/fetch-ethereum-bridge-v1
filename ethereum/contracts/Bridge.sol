/**
 * @title Bi-directional bridge for transferring FET tokens between Ethereum and Fetch Mainnet-v2
 *
 * @notice This bridge allows to transfer [ERC20-FET] tokens from Ethereum Mainnet to [Native FET] tokens on Fetch
 *         Native Mainnet-v2 and **other way around** (= it is bi-directional).
 *         User will be *charged* swap fee defined in counterpart contract deployed on Fetch Native Mainnet-v2.
 *         In the case of a refund, user will be charged a swap fee configured in this contract.
 *
 * @dev There are three primary actions defining business logic of this contract:
 *       * `swap(...)`: initiates swap of tokens from Ethereum to Fetch Native Mainnet-v2, callable by anyone (= users)
 *       * `reverseSwap(...)`: finalises the swap of tokens in *opposite* direction = receives swap originally
 *                             initiated on Fetch Native Mainnet-v2, callable exclusively by `relayer` role
 *       * `refund(...)`: refunds swap originally initiated in this contract(by `swap(...)` call), callable exclusively
 *                        by `relayer` role
 *
 *      Swap Fees for `swap(...)` operations (direction from this contract to are handled by the counterpart contract on Fetch Native Mainnet-v2, **except** for refunds, for
 *      which user is charged swap fee defined by this contract (since relayer needs to send refund transaction back to
 *      this contract.
 *
 *      ! IMPORTANT !: Current design of this contract does *NOT* allow to distinguish between *swap fees accrued* and
 *      *excess funds* sent to the address of this contract via *direct* `ERC20.transfer(...)`.
 *      Implication is, that excess funds **are treated** as swap fees.
 *      The only way how to separate these two is to do it *off-chain*, by replaying events from this and FET ERC20
 *      contracts, and do the reconciliation.
