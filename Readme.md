# Fetch-Ethereum-Bridge-v1
The docker-compose in the root of this repo is used to deploy the etehreum migraton contract in a local ganache container running in docker.

## Spin up infrastructure
By running `docker-compose up` a local ganache and a contract deployment container are being built and spinned up

If you always want to build images run `docker-compose up --build`.

After that, in a new terminal please run the following command depending on your desired action:
```/bin/bash
#Deploy contract
docker-compose exec contractdeployment npm run deplloy

# Run tests
docker-compose exec contractdeployment npm run test
```

The infrastructure can be deleted by running `docker-compose down`.
